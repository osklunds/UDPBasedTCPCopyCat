# UDPBasedTCPCopyCat

My own simplified TCP-like protocol that runs over UDP.

## Ideas to work on

- Alternative flow tests for client connect
- Alternative flow tests for shutdown
- Clean up client code
- Clean up Segment
- More Segment tests
- Make the server side work
- Test server and client together
- Flow control/num unacked bytes
- Example program, like netcat or an echo server
